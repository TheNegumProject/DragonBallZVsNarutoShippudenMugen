; Note the width controller. It makes KFM's push box larger, so he doesn't
; stand so close to the opponent. Hit Ctrl-C and look at the red bar at his
; feet.
; The sprpriority for this state is at -1, instead of the usual 2 for
; attacks. This makes KFM appear behind the opponent initially.
; The SprPriority controller in [State 210, 4] brings KFM to the front when
; his arm has swung over.
; To stop KFM from pausing in his swing frame, there is a ChangeAnim in
; [State 210, 3] that detects if the hit has come in contact with the
; opponent during that frame, and switches to the next animation element
; (notice the elem=6 parameter). If you don't see what I mean, try commenting
; out that controller, then hit someone with this attack.
