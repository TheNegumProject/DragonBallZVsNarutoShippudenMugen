;-------------- NARUTO'S README.txt ---------------------;
;--------------------------------------------------------;

Name: Naruto Uzumaki
Author: Alexei Roschak (kenshinx0)
Description: This is my third character using the NZC sprites. If I need to explain Naruto, then
you and I have a serious problem. XD
Version: 1.3
MUGEN Version: 1.0

Credits: 
Neimad for ripping the sprites from NZC.
Laharl and Ryon for beta testing.
Laharl for making the English soundpack.

Sounds:
Naruto has both an English and Japanese sound pack.
To change them just open up her .def file
and change the line that starts with "snd = " to one of the following:
snd = naruto_nzc.en.snd ; for English
OR
snd = naruto_nzc.jp.snd ; for Japanese

;-------------------- COMMANDS --------------------------;
;--------------------------------------------------------;

Basic Commands:
Walking - Yes
Run (Dashing) - Yes
Crouching - Yes
Jump - Yes
Launcher (via Crouching) - Yes
Air Dash - Yes

Commands are mapped across the a, b, and c keys for simple
play style. A is for lighter attacks, b for medium, and c for
clone based attacks that do a little extra damage but are slower.

Crouching + B is a counter. If naruto is hit in the final frame of his animation, he will teleport
underground and uppercut from the ground.

Format:
Command Name - Command - Power Requirements (If Applicable)
Description:
Notes: If any.

Special Movements:

Ryujinki Attack - QCB+a - 1000
Description: Naruto uses the Ryujinki (Dragon Blade) to dash at the enemy while cutting through them.

Rasengan - QCF+a - 1000
Description: Naruto summons a clone to help him build the Rasengan in his hand. The clone poofs away and Naruto lunges towards the enemy.
When Naruto gets close enough to player two, he'll thrust Rasengan into the enemy causing multiple hits of damage.
Note: I was debating this, but I decided against allowing Naruto to go into the air with this.
If timed correctly, Rasengan can be avoided by jumping out of the way.

Kyuubi Claw - QCB+b - 2000
Description: Naruto is engulfed by the hate and rage of Kyuubi residing inside him and launches himself
at the opponent with a red chakra arm extended. 
Note: Naruto will attempt to attack the enemy regardless of where they
are positined on screen.

Oodama Rasengan - QCF+b - 2000
Description: Similar to Rasengan, this Rasengan uses two clones to even contain Oodama Rasengan before thrusting it
into the opponent.
Note: Same mechanics apply as with Rasengan, but this one is larger and more powerful.

Kage Bunshin No Jutsu - QCF+c - 1000 or greater
Description: Naruto summons 1-3 clones to help him fight.
Note: The number of clones is dependant on the amount of power absorbed. 
One bar of power is equivalent to one clone.
The more clones out, the more randomly and less often they attack to be fair.
Any of Naruto's clones will die after being hit once.

Kyuubi Transformation 4 Tails - QCB+c - 3000
Description: Naruto is engulfed with the hate and rage of Kyuubi so much that Kyuubi takes over his body. During this time,
Kyuubi charges a black ball of energy in his mouth and fires it out as an enormous red and white beam that does massive damage.
Note: Kyuubi is vulnerable whilst charging the black energy ball.
Having that said, it's best to use this move far away from the enemy.

Rasenshuriken - QCF+z - 3000
Description: Naruto summons two clones to help him create the Rasenshuriken. Two more clones are summoned
that run up to the enemy and attempt to knock them into the air. Naruto holds it high and then lunges at the enemy with the mighty
shuriken. When the Rasenshuriken makes contact, it starts to expand until it expodes into a large rasengan of air and chakra.
Note: Naruto is vulnerable before lunging at the enemy.

Pressing z, after guarding at least one attack, will consume
200 power to teleport Naruto using Kawarimi. He will appear
behind P2 ready to start comboing. Kawarimi is a log.

;--------------------- CONCLUSION -----------------------;
;--------------------------------------------------------;
Naruto took the longest to make of any of my NZC characters thus far. This is because I put extra time and effort into him
to try out new techniques and add extra things such as more supers and hypers, as well as super and hyper protraits. He was
very fun to make and was designed to be balanced, yet powerful. He can use his basic attack clones for longer-than-normal ranged attacks
and can even summon some of them to aid him.

AI, as always, is by me and is scalable as all my AI has been lately.

Just a quick note to those want to comment on my site:
I love language and have no problem with any of it, but that doesn't mean I can speak nor understand all of it. If I can't make out
what you're trying to say, then you won't get a very useful answer from me. English is my main language and I suggest you use it to
communicate with me, otherwise, I'll just be lost in translation. :P Thank you and Enjoy.
