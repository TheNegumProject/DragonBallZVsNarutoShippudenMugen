Well... Here the latest updates of my chars, the Naruto and Sasuke V5. I 
added a lot of stuff here, most noticed changes in Naruto, which looks like
a brand new char ^^
This char is part of the KM Team now, and it'll be present in our game: 
Naruto Shippuden: The Last Generation. More information in KyubiMugen ^^

Credits
----------

-First of all, a lot of thanks (again) to ryuzazaky16, who (again) gave 
 me a lot of ideas, sprites, and suggestions for the char. If it wasn't
 for him, you'd be watching a complete different char now (waiting your BD gift, eh?
 xD).
-A LOT of Credit to Nestoruzumaki, who helped me in a lot of sprites, like
 the new stance, the Rasengan Launcher, the new 6 Paths mode, a LOT of addons,
 and much other stuff. You rule man, glad to be in the same tema as you ^^.
-Big credits to -True-, aka Jonas, who helped me in HDizing the effects of the
 whole char and introduced me to HiRes and HD world ^^. All HQ effects of this
 char were fixed by him.
