Fucinkg intro xD
Well... Here's my newest char, together with Naruto, Sasuke V5! I added more
stuff to Sasuke, fixed some old stuff, and it looks like the old char but with
new stuff... Hmm... Which's the word? Oh, right, updated xD
This new Sasuke has Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan, with a shape non-confirmed 
(fanmade) but it looks good anyway ^^
As Naruto, this char'll be in KyubiMugen's proyect: Naruto Shippuden: THe Last
Generation. More information, too, in KyubiMugen xD
