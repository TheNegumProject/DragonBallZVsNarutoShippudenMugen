1. Introduction (Naruto spoilers ahead)
---------------------

Hello again. Well... After the release of the new Sasuke character, I got a lot of 
good comments, saying that my Sasuke was the better out there, and that I should 
code the Sage Naruto too. Then, as soon as I finished the Sasuke updates with 
Susanoo and the Hawk and all, I started working in this char, so I could make
both chars compatible. Well, after some weeks of hard work, I came up with this
little character here. Then, some people loved my char, some others didn't liked
it, so I started another update on this char. I came with this version, so I hope
you like it now. 
I'm too lazy to write the whole Naruto's history, so let's just get in the char...

2. Credits
----------

-First of all, a lot of thanks (again) to ryuzazaky16, who (again) gave 
 me a lot of ideas, sprites, and suggestions for the char. If it wasn't
 for him, you'd be watching a complete different char now.
-Credit to Kamiru, Oxinion, Neimad, Vitorhdsp, BestPeter, and Eyeblz_rkz; 
for the Naruto sprites.
-Credit to Rock, for Gamabunta sprites,
-Credit to zxcv11791, for 4 Tails Kyubi sprites.
-Credit to ozkr331, for the Rasen Shuriken explosion I took from his sheet.
-Credit to whoever made the sheet from where I took the Rasen Shuriken,
 Cho Chakra Rasengan, and some other sprites.
